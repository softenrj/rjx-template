# RJX Express Boilerplate

This is a clean and modern vanilla JavaScript Express.js boilerplate generated by the command:

```
npm create-rjx my-app
```

Created by Raj, this boilerplate uses vanilla JavaScript with ES modules (ESM) to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Express applications.

## Key Features

- **Express 5** with modern JavaScript (ESM) support
- Environment configuration using `dotenv`
- Modular routing system
- Middleware setup including:
  - CORS with configurable allowed origins
  - Security headers via `helmet` (enabled in production)
  - HTTP request logging with `morgan` (different formats for dev and production)
- Static file serving from the `public` directory
- Centralized error handling with logging using `primelogger`
- Module aliasing for cleaner import paths (`@src`, `@common`, `@routes`)
- Useful utilities and constants organized under `src/common`
- Development tooling with `nodemon` for hot reloads
- Colorful console output with `chalk` and `chalk-animation` for better developer experience [ we will replace it in the upcomming version ]

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`  
  Starts the server in development mode with source maps enabled.

- `npm run dev_hot`  
  Starts the server with `nodemon` watching for file changes and hot reload.

- `npm start`  
  Starts the server in production mode with environment variables loaded and security middleware enabled.

- `npm run clean`  
  Cleans the project by removing `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and `dist` folder.

---

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure environment variables (e.g., `PORT`, `NodeEnv`).

3. Run the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Or run with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev_hot
```

5. For production, build and start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Module Aliasing

This project uses `module-alias` to simplify import paths. Aliases are configured in `package.json`:

```json
"_moduleAliases": {
  "@src": "src",
  "@common": "src/common",
  "@routes": "src/routes"
}
```

This allows importing modules like:

```js
import router from '@routes/index.js';
```

---

## Environment Support

- Uses `dotenv` to load environment variables from `.env` files.
- Environment-based configuration for logging and security:
  - Development: uses `morgan` with 'dev' format, no helmet.
  - Production: uses `morgan` with 'combined' format and enables `helmet` for security headers.
- Supports Node.js version 16 or higher.
