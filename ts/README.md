# RJX Boilerplate

A modern Express.js + TypeScript starter boilerplate generated by `npm create-rjx my-app` by Raj.

## Overview

This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Express.js applications using TypeScript. It includes essential middleware, structured routing, logging, error handling, and environment configuration out of the box.

## Features

- Express 5 with TypeScript
- Environment-based configuration
- CORS setup for localhost development
- Helmet for security in production
- Morgan logging (dev and production modes)
- Centralized error handling with custom error classes
- Modular routing system
- Static file serving from `public` directory
- Jet-logger integration for structured logging
- Colorful console output with chalk and chalk-animation [ we will replace it in the upcomming version ]
- entralized error handling with logging using `primelogger`
- Pre-configured scripts for development, build, lint, and testing
- ESLint and Vitest for code quality and testing

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev_hot
```

Or start the development server without hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Production

Start the production server (after build):

```bash
npm start
```
